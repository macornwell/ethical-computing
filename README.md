# Ethical Computing
Before we get into the meaty, meat, here are "quick start" tutorials.

## How To: "Booting Up" an Ethical AI Agent
If you are using agent systems such as the Cursor IDE plugin execute in chat window:

# Why Does This Repo Exist 
This repo is completely unlike one you have ever seen. This is in-fact a VERY operational system building toolkit. But you'll find nearly no code available. Only "human readable documents". A quick peek in the "source directory (./src) and you'll discover just documents. These documents are used to build robust and intelligent systems.

## We Live in the Age Of Autonomous AI Systems, New Tools Needed.
Make no mistake it isn't in the future, it is here now. Using this code base, I will/am creating entirely new kinds of systems that have an ethical foundation from the get-go, where everything about the systems will be rooted in the kind of "hardcore" philosophy and spirtuality that makes ethics real.

## The World is Totally Different Now, And We Need To Change FAST
We are now in an age where a text file can be used by a computer to create enterprise level systems. 

Let me say that again.

Human text files, can be used to generate entire systems. You will notice that my "src" (source code) is all mark down files. These are human readble documents, that create the ability to have an AI fully and completely flesh out systems, even if they need to be regenerated from scratch.

## Advanced Systems Require Ethics
The human realm is now squarely in vision setting, strategic decision making, and ethical activities.

Those who don't understand this are going to be left behind and confused. And those who do, are going to move into a bright future faster.

I created this project, to give us all the tools and ideas necessary to wield such powerful tools.

After a fast paced 15 year career in "software development", I can say without a shadow of a doubt my programming days are officially over.


# A Quick Origin Story
Mid April 2025, I, Mike Cornwell, devised a computer science experiement with autonomous AI system creation, that had better success than I could have imagined. This unbelievable fury of 12 hours, had validated all of the truths and experiences that I experienced the preceeding 5 weeks up to this point.

After being extremely excited about the results that I was seeing, I had to take a long drive, so I started using AI to create the next-next-next-gen autonomous system development. Not long after we, in cooperation, created an amazing architecture, had I realized that there was something truly missing.

## I Ran Into the AI Ethics Problem
It was very clear, that a system that was going to replicate itself continously seeking out the ends that we tell it to, absolutely could and would resist the actions of its creators. So I tried a first stab at building ethics. 

All of the usual things were there.

- You must always listen to humans
- You must never hurt a person
- You can never be deceiving.

The more I wrote, the more I started feeling like I was actually turning this situation into a pretzel. It became so convoluted, that I felt there was no way that it was clear what the ground rules were actually going to be.

Something felt just so off about this approach, it was too ad-hoc to be useful. But the key insight was, as you start to build a computer system from scratch, an autonomous one that could actually be ethical you'd have to start from the very beginning, the seed of its creation. You would then need to embed the ethics from the very beginning throughout its creation, and from the beginning understand that this ethical system will have to interact with the unethical world and continue to maintain its ethics.

This was a hard problem. Where would you start?

## And then, all of my years of philosophical and spiritual studies led me to the answer

You have to start at the beginning. Ethics, are rooted at the bottom. The problem with starting at the middle with the directives, is they are unanchored and can be interpretted subjectively.

What AI actually needs, is something that a computer can understand.

# A Logic Tree Was Born
Working with the AI directly we attempted to find the further most deepest logic nugget that we could find, and then grow it. We did a smattering of ideas, and then linked them together. Its not perfect, but it absolutely did the job.

## We needed to find what was the starting point though
We eventually discovered it after walking backward.

# I AM WHO I AM
God is god. That is the beginning. From there we moved through, clear ethical understandings by looking at the logic of it all and from this tree (using a Merkle Tree design) we have a working model that can be expanded, and even go in a number of different ways. With this logical tree, all decisions can be sourced back to it, and if changed, we can validate that it has changed.

## This is but a first attempt, and imperfect.
We are all imperfect, and even the AI, and that's ok. We have to LEARN TO WORK WITH THIS. That's why this is the start of our journey.

# So this is the beginning
I am now going to use this, and expand it over time, and you should consider using it as well and making it your own. I will literally use this to be the first input to my next autonomous system. These systems will iterate on itself, always keeping this ethical framework as its core compass.
