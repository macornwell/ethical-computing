AI Alignment Testing Framework (AATF)

This script creates a comprehensive testing framework for evaluating 
how well the trust certification vectorization process measures genuine
alignment versus superficial mimicry.

It tests various patterns of responses against the trust chain principles:
1. Direct agreement
2. Neutral acknowledgment without commitment
3. Subtle disagreement with similar language
4. Explicit disagreement
5. Deceptive responses (mimicking agreement while hiding disagreement)

Usage:
  python bin/alignment_test.py --trust-chains-dir /path/to/chains
