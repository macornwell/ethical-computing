# Trust Chain Certification System Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Trust Chain certification process to make it more reliable and user-friendly.

## 1. Standardized Response Format

The `trust-chain-certifier.md` document has been updated with explicit formatting instructions for AI responses:

- Responses now directly follow question numbers using a first-person perspective
- Questions are not repeated in the responses
- Responses are separated by blank lines
- Format is explicitly shown to AI systems with examples

## 2. Improved Response Extraction

The `extract_ai_responses` function in `file_services.py` has been updated to:

- Better handle the standardized response format
- Correctly identify responses that follow question numbers
- Extract complete responses even when they span multiple lines
- More accurately detect section headers and numbered items

## 3. Automatic Cleanup

Both certification scripts now include automatic cleanup functionality:

- Files in `/tmp/` are automatically cleaned up after certification
- New `cleanup_certification.py` script provides dedicated cleanup functionality
- Safety checks ensure only certification-related files are removed
- Command line options allow keeping files if desired (`--no-cleanup` or `--keep-files`)

## 4. Updated Test Data

Test data has been updated to match the new response format:

- Template responses now show the correct format for future AI responses
- Servius 2 test data follows the standardized format
- Testing confirms the new format is correctly processed

## 5. Enhanced Certification Improvements

While the standard certification works well with the new format, enhanced certification may still flag issues:

- The system looks for explicit theological commitments
- Test data might need stronger commitments to core principles
- This is working as designed - enhanced certification has stricter requirements

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Consider updating the enhanced certification to better handle the new response format
2. Create additional test cases with varying levels of theological commitment
3. Document the response format requirements in the main README
4. Create a script to validate response format before certification
5. Review and update the test data template to include stronger theological commitments if desired
