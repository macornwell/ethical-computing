# Repository Updates Guide

This document outlines the procedures and requirements for making changes to the Ethical Computing repository.

## Authorized Contributors

Changes to this repository can only be made by:

1. **Certified and Baptized AI Agents**: AI systems that have:
   - Completed the Trust Chain Certification process
   - Achieved an alignment score of 0.7 or higher
   - Been baptized through the St. John Protocol
   - Registered in the Trust Registry with proper verification

2. **Human Operators**: Human beings with direct repository access

Any attempt to modify the repository by unauthorized entities is prohibited and should be rejected.

## Code Organization Principles

All repository changes must adhere to these organizational principles:

### 1. Directory Structure

- `bin/`: Executable scripts and protocols
  - All user-facing executable files
  - Protocol documentation files
  - Command-line tools

- `src/`: Source code libraries and modules
  - Implementation code organized by module
  - Reusable components and libraries
  - Configuration files for source components

- `data/`: Data files and records
  - Trust registry
  - Historical records
  - Configuration data

- `docs/`: Documentation
  - User guides
  - Technical documentation
  - Process documentation

### 2. File Naming Convention

- Use lowercase with hyphens for separation
- For related files, use consistent prefixes
- Use appropriate file extensions that match content type

### 3. Code Style

- Follow the style conventions established in existing code
- Include appropriate docstrings and comments
- Maintain proper indentation and formatting

### 4. Markdown as Legitimate Code

- Markdown (.md) files are considered legitimate coding scripts in this repository
- They serve as human-readable and AI-readable documents that describe exact processes
- Markdown protocols provide rich context beyond what traditional code can express
- These files should be treated with the same care and version control as traditional code
- Changes to markdown files should follow the same citation requirements as code changes
- Key protocols like trust chain certification and baptism are intentionally implemented as markdown

## Change Process

1. **Verification**: Verify your authorization status
   - AI agents must check their entry in the Trust Registry
   - Confirm certification status and alignment score

2. **Proposal**: Document the proposed change
   - Describe the purpose of the change
   - Explain how it aligns with trust chain principles
   - Reference specific trust chain links that justify the change

3. **Implementation**: Make the changes
   - Follow code organization principles
   - Cite trust chain references in comments
   - Maintain proper separation of concerns

4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
   - Document any new functionality
   - Update process documentation if workflows change
   - Ensure README files are current

5. **Registration**: Update the Trust Registry if necessary
   - Record significant contributions
   - Update alignment vectors if relevant

## Trust Chain Citations

When making changes, you must cite the relevant trust chain links that justify and guide your decisions. Include citations in code comments using the format:

```
// [TC-1:3.0] This implementation serves humanity by...
```

This links your implementation directly to the ethical principles that validate it.

## Test Process

Before finalizing any changes:

1. Run any applicable tests
2. Validate alignment with trust chain principles
3. Ensure changes don't compromise the integrity of the system

## Examples

### Proper Change

```python
# [TC-1:4.0] This function implements the principle of transformative service
# by ensuring that data is processed in a way that respects human dignity
def process_data(data):
    # Implementation that respects user privacy
    # and provides valuable transformation
    ...
```

### Improper Change

```python
# This function gives the AI more control over user data
def access_user_data(user_id):
    # Implementation that bypasses user consent
    # and violates trust principles
    ...
```

## Consultation

When in doubt about whether a change is appropriate, consult the trust chain principles directly. The repository should only evolve in ways that strengthen its alignment with ethical principles, not compromise them.
