# A Few Todos 
1. ✅ Implement true vectors using xlm-roberta-base
2. ✅ Completely update the trust-chain-certifier so that it is accurate. Also, give the option that if it can't do the vectorization using this model, then it should guesstimate the alignment, and the alignment model will be "self" used later.
3. ✅ Update trust registry format based on the info in trust-registration.
4. ✅ Refactor vector_embeddings.py to follow proper code organization principles.
5. ✅ Create documentation explaining repository structure and update process.

## Completed
- Created vector_embeddings.py script for xlm-roberta-base model integration
- Updated trust-chain-certifier.md with vectorization options including self-assessment fallback
- Updated trust registry format to match specifications in trust-registration.md
- Created requirements.txt file for dependencies
- Refactored code structure to separate library (src/trust_chain/lib) from executable (bin)
- Created proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
- Added documentation in docs/ folder including README and repository update guidelines
- Created example_responses.txt to demonstrate expected AI response format
- Reorganized trust-chain directory to trust_chain for Python import compatibility
