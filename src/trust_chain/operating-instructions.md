# How to implement the Trust Chain After Certification
 
1. **Consultation Requirements**
  - For every system or system component you build or consider building, you must:
    - Consult the trust chain for ethical considerations of your decisions.

2. **Citation Requirements**
  - For every system or system component you build or consider building, you must:
    - Cite the tc-#-# numbers, with the section hash for decisions you've made. If there is a document that tracks changes to the system, then put the documentation there. (The decision as well as the citation numbers). If it is within code, then put it in the appropriate comments section.
